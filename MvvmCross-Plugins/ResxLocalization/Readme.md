### ResxLocalization

The `ResxLocalization` plugin provides a support class to help use RESX files for internationalization (i18n).

The `ResxLocalization` plugin is a single PCL Assembly and isn't really a typical plugin - it doesn't itself register any singletons or services with the MvvmCross IoC container.

For advice on using the Localization library, see:
